## Overview of the Analysis:
Geneticists have identified locations in the human genome that can assess an individual's ancestry, called ancestry-informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (AISNPs). These locations, denoted by rsid numbers, display ancestry-specific variation. The overall purposes of this analysis is to ...
